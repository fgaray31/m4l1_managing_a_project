APOLOGIZE: This repo was forked from Genaro Alvarez Github repository. I wasn't able to find the linked resource from Coursera's website due to error 404. 
I did it because I need to continue with the course I'm actually taking: 

Meta Database Engineer Professional Certificate/Week 4: Version Control/Exercise: Managing a project in GitHub

I apologize to Genaro Alvarez and Coursera. 
Sincerely: Felix Garay
